# Microservice Project Algo

1. Init new repository
2. Transferred project starter kit to new repository
3. Stubbed the project submission screenshots in /screenshots and added one for Github Travis Webhook
4. Set my environment variables in my ~/.bash_profile:

```
export POSTGRES_USERNAME=;
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=;
export POSTGRES_DB=udagrammercerdev;
export POSTGRES_HOST=udagrammercerdev.chy5z7qtq32g.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com;

export AWS_REGION=us-east-2;
export AWS_PROFILE=default;
export AWS_BUCKET=udagram-mercer-dev;

export JWT_SECRET=
export URL=http://localhost:8100
```
5. Deleted package-lock.json file transferred from original microservice /project folder
